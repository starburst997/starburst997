ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Notessimo](https://notessimo.net)! (and also a [secret project](https://www.neonrumble.com/))

An hybrid between [Mario Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Paint) and old-school [tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) along with a [community](https://community.notessimo.net) to share and discuss music.

Notessimo offer an intuitive music composition experience for persons of all ages with a focus on simplicity and merging sounds with visuals.

Most of the good stuff are in my private repositories ;) but feel free to browse! It is mostly a bunch of forks with bug fixes / modifications.
