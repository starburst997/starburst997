🔭 I’m currently working on [Notessimo](https://notessimo.net) (Unity / C# / React / NextJS)!

An hybrid between [Mario Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Paint) and old-school [tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) along with a [community](https://community.notessimo.net) to share and discuss music.

Notessimo offer an intuitive music composition experience for persons of all ages with a focus on simplicity and merging sounds with visuals.
